== Introduction ==

As a start, I'd like to thank you for trying out my beta admin mod, Evolve. Installing will be a cakewalk if you follow these instructions. Just drop 'evolve' in your server's addons directory and continue reading.

== How do I become owner? ==

If you're running a listen server, you're always owner. If you're running a dedicated server, join your server and type the following in the dedicated server console:

	ev rank yourname owner

== How do I make people admin or super admin? ==

Either...
Type in chat: !rank playername admin/superadmin
Use the menu: Select player -> Administration -> Rank -> Admin/Super Admin
Use the dedicated server console: ev rank playername admin/superadmin

The following ranks are available: guest, respected, admin, superadmin and owner. Note that people with the rank owner can only be demoted using the console and people can only be promoted to owner using the console. You can see the console as owner+ if you want.

== How do I open the menu? ==

Just bind a key to +ev_menu. Note that this will likely change in the future, so keep watching this file!

== HOW TO FIX THE KICK/BAN CRASHES UNTIL IT IS FIXED IN GMOD ITSELF ==

Copy gmsv_gatekeeper.dll to lua/includes/modules on your server and the crashes will be gone.

== Feature suggestions? Bugs found? ==
