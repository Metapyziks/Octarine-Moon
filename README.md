Description
===========
Overview
--------
A Trouble in Terrorist Town based server for Garrys Mod 12, using the Evolve
Admin Plugin. Currently features custom weapons and some gameplay changes, and
many new Evolve commands to interface with TTT.

Custom Weapons
--------------
### Dart Gun (Traitor)
The Dart Gun is a two-shot, single purchase crossbow that fires poisoned darts.
When a player is poisoned they turn green and silently loose health at a steady
rate. The target player will be unaware that they are poisoned unless they
notice their health dropping, or are told by another player.

The player will die from their affliction unless a Detective purchases a health
station, which will sustain the poisoned player until they are cured after
about two minutes. Watch out though - health stations can be poisoned too,
poisoning any player that uses it.

When the player dies from poison, a trace of the DNA of the poisoner can be
found on their body. It decays very rapidly though, so usually the player must
die right next to a Detective to have any change of the poisoner being found.
